# Enhanced PDF Scanner - Handles Additions AND Deletions

## ✅ **Yes! Now It Does Both**

Your PDF scanner can now be run multiple times and will:

1. ✅ **Add new files** found on disk but not in database
2. ✅ **Delete database records** for files no longer on disk
3. ✅ **Skip existing files** that haven't changed (default behavior)

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Default Behavior** (Recommended):
```bash
python scan_pdf_files.py
```

**What happens:**
1. **🧹 Cleanup**: Removes database records for deleted files
2. **🔍 Scan**: Finds all PDF files in directory  
3. **➕ Add**: Inserts new files not already in database
4. **⏭️ Skip**: Ignores files already in database

### **Cleanup Options:**
```bash
# Normal sync (cleanup + add new files)
python scan_pdf_files.py

# Skip cleanup, only add new files
python scan_pdf_files.py --no-cleanup

# Only cleanup deleted files, don't scan for new ones
python scan_pdf_files.py --cleanup-only

# Force re-scan all files (including existing)
python scan_pdf_files.py --force
```

## 📊 **Enhanced Output Examples**

### **Normal Run** (with cleanup):
```bash
$ python scan_pdf_files.py

Step 1: Cleaning up records for deleted files...
Checking 2,834 database records against disk...
Found 23 files that no longer exist on disk
  Deleted: old_cert_001.pdf (was: C:\...\pdfs\old_cert_001.pdf)
  Deleted: old_cert_002.pdf (was: C:\...\pdfs\old_cert_002.pdf)
  ... and 21 more in this batch
Successfully deleted 23 records for files no longer on disk

Found 1,247 files already in database
Found 2,850 PDF files in directory
Files to insert: 39
Files skipped (already exist): 2,811

Batch 1: Inserted 39 files

==================================================
PDF File Scan Complete
==================================================
Total files processed: 2,850
Files added to database: 39
Files skipped (existing): 2,811
Files deleted (no longer on disk): 23

✅ Scan completed successfully!
   Files processed: 2,850
   Files added: 39
   Files skipped: 2,811
   Files deleted: 23
```

### **Cleanup Only**:
```bash
$ python scan_pdf_files.py --cleanup-only

Checking 2,834 database records against disk...
Found 5 files that no longer exist on disk
Successfully deleted 5 records for files no longer on disk

✓ Cleanup completed successfully!
   Files deleted from database: 5
```

### **No Cleanup** (add only):
```bash
$ python scan_pdf_files.py --no-cleanup

Found 2,834 files already in database
Found 2,845 PDF files in directory
Files to insert: 11
Files skipped (already exist): 2,834

✅ Scan completed successfully!
   Files processed: 2,845
   Files added: 11
   Files skipped: 2,834
```

## 🎯 **Perfect for Regular Use**

Now you can:

### **Daily/Regular Sync**:
```bash
# Run this regularly - handles everything automatically
python scan_pdf_files.py
```

### **Specific Scenarios**:
```bash
# Just clean up deleted files
python scan_pdf_files.py --cleanup-only

# Add new files without cleanup (faster)
python scan_pdf_files.py --no-cleanup

# Check directory stats without DB operations
python scan_pdf_files.py --stats
```

### **Integration with Main CLI**:
```bash
# Same functionality via main CLI
python main.py scan-pdf
python main.py scan-pdf --force
```

## 🔧 **How Deletion Detection Works**

1. **📋 Gets all database records** with their `full_path`
2. **🔍 Checks each file path** against disk using `Path.exists()`
3. **🗑️ Marks missing files** for deletion
4. **⚡ Batch deletes** records for files no longer on disk
5. **📊 Reports** how many files were cleaned up

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

- **Batch processing**: Deletes in batches of 100 for performance
- **Detailed logging**: Shows which files are being deleted
- **Transaction safety**: Uses database transactions
- **Error handling**: Continues even if some operations fail
- **Verification**: Only deletes records where file path doesn't exist

## ✅ **Result**

Your PDF scanner is now a **complete sync tool** that:
- ✅ Adds new PDF files to database
- ✅ Removes records for deleted files  
- ✅ Skips unchanged existing files
- ✅ Provides detailed progress reporting
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Can be run multiple times safely

**Perfect for regular maintenance!** 🎉

Run it whenever you want to sync your database with the actual PDF files on disk.
